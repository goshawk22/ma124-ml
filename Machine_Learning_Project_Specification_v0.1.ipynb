    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Machine Learning is the use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data. In machine learning we are interested in creating functions or models which fit real data. Such functions can be found by making them dependent on a number of parameters which are updated over and over again to improve the fit to the data. You will explore in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested reading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many great articles, books, videos about machine learning. This list just picks out a few:\n",
