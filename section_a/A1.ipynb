    "### Task A1 - Linear Regression machine learning task using SciKitLearn\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent research article published in the journal Computer Communications, authors Sathishkumar V E, Jangwoo Park, and Yongyun Cho sought to predict the \"bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes\"[1]. They employed several regression models, including linear regression. The dataset used in the original study is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Apply machine learning to a modified version of the original dataset and report the results.\n",

    "The original research article and a modified dataset are posted on the MA124 Moodle page in the resources for this project. You will need to refer to the article for some of the tasks below. You will need to download SeoulBikeData_mod.csv and put it into the folder with this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "SeoulBikeData_mod.csv has been modified from the original dataset to remove the categorical variables, and to convert dates to months. Months have been coded by number, e.g. 1 = January, etc. Only half the months are included in the modified dataset.\n",

    "While the number of tasks is large, this is in part because the instructions are rather specific. Many of them are very similar to things you saw in term 1, in the week 8 and week 10 notebooks and lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically, your code should**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import needed libraries. (You will need pandas, as well as things from sklearn, and of course numpy and matplotlib.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using pandas, read SeoulBikeData_mod.csv into a Dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `describe` the Dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot a histogram of `Rented Bike Count`. Do not plot this as a density, but as a count. See Fig. 3 of the article. The vertical axis in the article is labelled \"frequency\", but is the same as the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Produce a box plot similar to that in Fig. 3 of the article.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Try to generate both the histogram and box plot to look approximately as they do in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. From the full Dataframe, create a new Dataframe `X` containing all the columns except `Rented Bike Count` and a Series `y` containing only the `Rented Bike Count` column. These are your design matrix and target respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Perform a test-train split to create `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train` and `y_test`. You **must** use the same percentage of data for testing and training as was used in the article and you **must** state what they are. You can find these in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create and train a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use the trained model to obtain `y_pred`, the prediction on the test data `X_test`. Form the residual `resid = y_test - y_pred`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Compute and report: Rsquared (R2), the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Variation (CV). Compare these results to those on the top, right of Table 4 of the article. (Note, the modified dataset we are studying is different from that used in the article. Hence the results will not be identical. However, the procedure is very close to that used in the article.)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Produce and comment on the following plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histograms of `y_test` and of `y_pred` (on the same plot). These should be reported as counts rather than densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A scatter plot of `resid` as a function of `y_test` corresponding to Fig. 9 of the article. (Recall what `y_test` represents and label the plot appropriately.) Unlike Fig. 9 of the paper, you should use a colormap to plot the different `Hours` in different colours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A scatter plot of `resid` as a function of `X_test['Month']`. Use a colormap to indicate the absolute value of `resid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A scatter plot of `resid` as a function of `X_test['Rainfall(mm)']`. Use a colormap to indicate the absolute value of `resid`.\n",
